<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully built an AI-powered PRD/BRD analysis application from scratch, focusing on delivering core value incrementally. The trajectory details the progression from initial MVP planning to a fully functional application, including AI-driven gap analysis, robust document parsing (PDF, DOCX), user authentication, and advanced workflow generation. Key challenges involved integrating LLMs (Gemini chosen after user input), refining AI prompts for accurate document-specific analysis, and iteratively improving the UI/UX, particularly for workflow visualization. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by addressing user feedback on UI themes, document support, authentication, and the accuracy and rendering of generated workflows. The final task addressed was fixing incomplete workflow rendering, which was still outstanding when the trajectory ended with a save to github finish the job instruction.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an AI-powered web application for product designers and cross-functional teams to visually interpret and act on PRDs/BRDs.
Key features include:
1.  **Document Parsing & Visualization**: Upload/paste PRD/BRD (PDF, DOCX, Notion, Markdown), extract structured data (user stories, features, goals, constraints, timelines, stakeholders), and visualize as hierarchical mind map/flow diagram.
2.  **Gap Identification & Analysis**: AI detects gaps, inconsistencies, vague definitions, tech dependencies, and suggests solutions categorized as Business Gap or Design Ambiguity.
3.  **Edge Case Detection**: AI generates and categorizes edge cases; allows manual tagging.
4.  **Workflow Generation & Customization**: Generate editable user flows, UX journeys, or service blueprints with drag-and-drop. Connect gaps/edge cases to workflow steps. Export to Figma, Miro, images/PDF.
5.  **Collaboration & Feedback**: Inline commenting, shareable project links (comment/edit access), feedback summaries grouped by roles.
6.  **AI/NLP Capabilities**: Use LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), NER (spaCy), visual NLP parsers.
7.  **UI Mockup Overview**: Dashboard, Document Visualizer (Outline, Mind Map, Panels), Gap Analysis Tab, Workflow Generator, Collaboration Panel.
8.  **Technical Architecture**: React + TailwindCSS (Frontend), D3.js/Mermaid.js for visualization, Zustand/Redux, WebSockets. Node.js + Express, Python microservice (FastAPI) for NLP/LLM, Postgres, Redis. OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini APIs, spaCy, LangChain/Semantic Kernel, PDF/DOC parsers. JWT Auth, Role-based permissions.
The application was enhanced to include PDF and Word document parsing, a full sign-up/sign-in authentication system with JWT, and a dark UI theme with purple accents. The workflow generation was refined to produce document-specific professional flowcharts with proper shapes and download functionality (PNG/JPG).

- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic for API overloads.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


**Detailed Directory Structure:**


-   :
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application. Handles API routes for document upload, AI analysis (gap and workflow), user authentication (sign-up, sign-in), and user-specific data storage. Integrates with Gemini LLM using  and document parsing libraries.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial setup with basic endpoints, then enhancements for PDF/DOCX parsing, JWT authentication, and all AI logic for gap analysis and workflow generation. Significant changes focused on improving AI prompting, handling markdown in AI responses, and refining workflow generation logic for document specificity and decision points. Robust error handling and retry logic for external API calls were also added.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: The main React component rendering the user interface. Manages application state, handles user interactions, makes API calls to the backend, and displays analysis results and workflows. It includes components for document upload, mode switching (Analysis/Workflow), and integration of the  component.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial UI setup, integration of AI analysis display, implementation of sign-in/sign-up forms and authentication state management. Later, significant modifications for the workflow generator toggle, selection of workflow types, and rendering of the generated workflows. Recently updated to integrate .

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Contains global and component-specific styles for the React application, primarily using Tailwind CSS directives.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to implement a dark theme with purple accents and glass effects, matching the user's reference image for an enhanced aesthetic.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: A newly created React component responsible for rendering the complex, professional flowcharts with proper shapes (rectangles, diamonds, ovals) and branching logic. It aims to provide a visually appealing and accurate representation of the generated workflows, and includes download functionality for PNG/JPG.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was recently created to address the user's request for professional flowchart visualization with proper shapes and download capabilities. It was still undergoing fixes for incomplete rendering at the end of the trajectory.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Workflow Visualization & Download**: The workflow output is still reported as incomplete and not rendering properly as a professional flowchart, despite the  component being implemented. The download functionality (PNG/JPG) for workflows was also part of this last set of changes and needs to be verified as working once the rendering is fixed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving a critical issue reported by the user: workflow is not generated and the output is not in a readable format (Message 102), which later evolved into workflow generation still not matching the prd (Message 158) and this the output of the generated workflow, and it looks incomplete (Message 197).

The specific work in progress focused on:
1.  **Improving AI prompt engineering**: To ensure the Gemini LLM accurately extracts and structures workflow details directly from the PRD, including precise decision points and branching logic, rather than generating generic flows. This involved refining AI configuration (e.g., lower temperature) and prompt instructions in .
2.  **Enhancing Workflow Visualization**: Developing the  component to render workflows as professional flowcharts with distinct shapes (rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions, ovals for start/end points) and proper connecting arrows, matching the user's visual reference.
3.  **Implementing Download Functionality**: Adding options to download the generated flowcharts as PNG and JPG images.

The very last exchange (Messages 197-201) indicates that despite previous attempts, the  component was still not rendering the workflow completely or correctly. The AI's last action was editing  to fix rendering and then restarting the frontend, but the user's explicit request for save to github finish the job (Message 202) came before confirmation of this fix. Therefore, the **incomplete rendering of the professional flowchart** is the precise issue left to be verified or fixed.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify and fix the rendering of the  component to ensure complete and correct display of generated workflows.
